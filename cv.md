Summary: I know that some say it is best to not ever meet your heroes, but meeting Bugs Bunny someday is a goal of mine. Science enthralls me and I have a lot of other interests, but I don't have the spacetime to list them all here. I love learning useful stuff, or even useless stuff as long as it's fascinating. I can fire up intense curiosity about almost anything and enjoy working as part of a team. Teamwork is truly my passion, as made evident by my coaching career in the USA (and now in Europe). American Football is the sport of Maximum Teamwork and it is a million times more strategically complex than chess. I currently coach for the Krakow Kings in Poland.

Skills: I am an excellent parallel parker. Analysis and team building are also in my wheelhouse.

For code examples, search for a chrome extension called "catloaf" that I've made.

Education: Baccalaureate degree earned in mathematics from Western Oregon University

I am a native speaker of English.
