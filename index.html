        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I know that some say it is best to not ever meet your heroes, but meeting Bugs Bunny someday is a goal of mine. Science enthralls me and I have a lot of other interests, but I do not have the spacetime to list them all here. I love learning useful stuff, or even useless stuff as long as it is fascinating. I can fire up intense curiosity about almost anything and enjoy working as part of a team. Teamwork is truly my passion, as made evident by my coaching career in the USA (and now in Europe). American Football is the sport of maximum teamwork and it is a million times more strategically complex than chess. I currently coach for the Krakow Kings in Poland.</p>

          <h2>My Skills</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I am an excellent parallel parker and because I earned my baccalaureate degree in mathematics from Western Oregon University, I can divide by zero (well, kind of) I have been tinkering with code for a while and only recently have gotten serious about it. If you would like to see an example, search for a chrome extension called "catloaf". Development on that project will resume after the football season.</p>
